What I have done so far:

	Solved closed form analytical equations of motion for arm with dry friction and viscous damping
		
		This means I specify initial joint angles, angular velocities, the 9 friction parameters 
		(static friction, kinetic friction and viscous damping) and a timestep and the model will output 
		the new joint positions an velocities at that time

	Made visualization in openGL to compare estimated friction parameters to "ground truth" parameters
