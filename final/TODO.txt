Use heaviside func to model stick-slip friction
	-wrote heaviside func into EOM solver script, scipy ODEint is having trouble handling piecewise funcs

	-might(?) try using the Pade Approximant

	-look into alternate forms of sympy codegen - check out Theano

	-> DiracDelta should be able to do the same thing as Heaviside
		integral(DiracDelta) = Heaviside



looks like scipy-integrate does not play nicely with analytical integration
	-going to try using the sympy integration tools - need to learn them first

	-check out scipy.integrate.solve_ivp
		-have to set up variable like a function(?)

	good news! we're getting all the way to line 264 with the step func, so kanes method is working fine

		Try to reformulate friction using DiracDelta instead of Heaviside


Lambdify vs NumPy / Scipy for performance


pretty_print() is not pretty enough
