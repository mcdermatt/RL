Use heaviside func to model stick-slip friction
	-wrote heaviside func into EOM solver script, scipy ODEint is having trouble handling piecewise funcs

	-might(?) try using the Pade Approximant

	-look into alternate forms of sympy codegen - check out Theano

looks like scipy-integrate does not play nicely with analytical integration
	-going to try using the sympy integration tools - need to learn them first

	-check out scipy.integrate.solve_ivp
		-have to set up variable like a function(?)
