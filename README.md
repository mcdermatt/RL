Comp 138: Reinforcement Learning



Part 1: Direct Friction Identification

	cd final

	<python viz2.py> - compares trajectories of "ground truth" and best estimated parameters

	/tests/simplified_model/1link - graveyard of failed attempts at parameter estimation

Part 2: Torque control
	
	cd torque_control

	<python viz.py> #Runs OpenGL visualization of arm attempting to reach position setpoints from random initial configuration
					# 	runs off of specified "path.npy" and "goal_path.npy" obtained from: 
						/tests/3DOF/gen_path_from_policy_variable_goal.py


	/tests/3dof/
	<python main_with_variable_goal.py> #trains model with random starting states, generates actor and critic checkpoints saved in 
											/checkpoints/ dir

	/tests/3dof/
	<python view_results.py> view actor loss, critic loss, and reward plots

	/tests/3dof/
	<python gen_path_from_policy.py> generates path of arm for viz basd on random inputs and the policy generated by the main func 					stored in the /checkpoints/ directory

	/demo/ - videos and GIFs of different tests run on various policies

	/tests/3DOF/ solve_EOM_combined_friction_model.py - solves EOM and saves as func to binary file
