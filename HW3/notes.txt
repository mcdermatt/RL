pymunk - 2d physics simulation (might not work)

PyDy - will definately work, may be overkill


Workflow:
1- Decide on scope of problem
2- Make model of runner in PyDy
	a- model sliding ladder problem
	b- model simplified human
	c- model two legged human

3- Solve for equations of motion and save to external function file with CloudPickle
4- Make PyGame Visualizer
5- Add joint limits (no backward bending knees)
6- GROUND PLANE??
